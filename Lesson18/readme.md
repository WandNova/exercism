Introduction
A str in Python is an immutable sequence of Unicode code points.
These could include letters, diacritical marks, positioning characters, numbers, currency symbols, emoji, punctuation, space and line break characters, and more.
Being immutable, a str object's value in memory doesn't change; methods that appear to modify a string return a new copy or instance of that str object.
